# Logo Change Guide - Issue Fixed! âœ…

## Problem Solved
The error you encountered was about the missing app icon (`ic_launcher`), not the logo itself. I've fixed this by:

1. âœ… Changed AndroidManifest.xml to use `@drawable/ic_launcher` instead of `@mipmap/ic_launcher`
2. âœ… Created `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.xml` - the app icon that appears on your phone's home screen

## Now You Can Change Your Logo Successfully

Since you've already placed `logo.png` in the drawable folder and deleted `logo.xml`, your logo change should work perfectly!

### Current Status:
- âœ… App icon (ic_launcher.xml) - Fixed and created
- âœ… Your logo.png - Already placed by you
- âœ… AndroidManifest.xml - Updated to reference correct icon

## Test Your App Now

1. **Clean and build** your project:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew build
   ```

2. **Run the app** - You should see:
   - Your custom `logo.png` on the splash screen
   - Your custom `logo.png` on error screens
   - RNZ app icon on your phone's home screen

## If You Want to Change the App Icon Too

The app icon (what appears on your phone's home screen) is currently a vector drawable. To change it:

### Option 1: Replace with PNG
1. Create `ic_launcher.png` (512x512px recommended)
2. Place it in `app/src/main/res/drawable/`
3. Delete `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.xml`

### Option 2: Edit the Vector
Edit `app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher.xml` to customize the design.

## Summary of Files

- **logo.png** (your file) â†’ Used in splash screen and error overlay
- **ic_launcher.xml** (created by me) â†’ App icon on home screen
- **AndroidManifest.xml** (fixed by me) â†’ Now references correct icon

Your logo change should work perfectly now! ðŸŽ‰
