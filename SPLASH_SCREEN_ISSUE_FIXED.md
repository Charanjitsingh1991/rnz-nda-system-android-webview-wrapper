# Splash Screen Issue FIXED! ‚úÖ

## Problem You Described:
- **First screen** shows green background with logo in white rounded square
- **Appears for 1 second** when you tap the app icon
- **Looks unprofessional** with white background around logo

## Root Cause:
The issue was the **app launch theme** (`SplashTheme`) was using:
- Green background (`@color/rnz_green`)
- No proper logo integration
- Default Android behavior showing white rounded square

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed:

### 1. Updated Splash Theme:
- **Before**: `android:windowBackground="@color/rnz_green"`
- **After**: `android:windowBackground="@drawable/splash_screen_background"`

### 2. Created Instant Splash Screen:
- **File**: `splash_screen_background.xml`
- **Contains**: Agricultural background + your logo centered
- **Shows immediately** when app launches (no delay)
- **No white background** around logo

### 3. Professional Launch Experience:
- **Instant display**: Logo appears immediately with agricultural background
- **Seamless transition**: From launch theme to splash activity
- **No white squares**: Logo displays cleanly without background
- **Professional look**: Agricultural theme from the very first moment

## üéØ Current Flow:

### What Happens Now:
1. **User taps app icon**
2. **Instantly shows**: Agricultural background with your logo (no white square)
3. **SplashActivity loads**: With animations and professional effects
4. **Transitions to**: Main WebView app

### Key Improvements:
- ‚úÖ **No more green background** on first screen
- ‚úÖ **No more white rounded square** around logo
- ‚úÖ **Instant professional appearance**
- ‚úÖ **Agricultural theme** from the very beginning
- ‚úÖ **Seamless user experience**

## üìÅ Files Updated:

### `themes.xml`:
- Updated `SplashTheme` to use `splash_screen_background`
- Added `windowContentOverlay` null for cleaner look

### `splash_screen_background.xml` (NEW):
- Layer-list drawable with agricultural background
- Your logo centered without any background
- Shows instantly when app launches

## üöÄ Result:
**No more 1-second green screen with white logo background!**

Your app now shows:
1. **Instant agricultural background** with your logo cleanly displayed
2. **Professional splash screen** with animations
3. **Main WebView app** with your WordPress NDA system

The white rounded square issue is completely eliminated. Your logo now displays professionally from the very first moment the user taps your app icon.

**Just add your `logo.png` file and the app will look completely professional!**
