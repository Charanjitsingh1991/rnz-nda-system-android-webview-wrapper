# Final Logo Setup - All Issues Resolved! ✅

## Current Status:
- ✅ Removed `logo.xml` (had circle elements causing errors)
- ✅ Removed `logo_alternative.xml` (had circle elements causing errors)  
- ✅ Fixed `ic_launcher.xml` (app icon - no more circle elements)
- ✅ Your `logo.png` should be in `app/src/main/res/drawable/`

## To Complete Your Logo Change:

1. **Verify your logo.png is in place:**
   ```bash
   # Check if your logo.png exists
   ls app/src/main/res/drawable/logo.png
   ```

2. **If your logo.png is missing, place it now:**
   - Copy your `logo.png` file to `app/src/main/res/drawable/logo.png`
   - Make sure it's named exactly `logo.png`

3. **Build your app:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## What Should Happen:
- **Splash Screen**: Shows your custom `logo.png` (large size)
- **Error Screen**: Shows your custom `logo.png` (small size)  
- **Home Screen**: Shows the RNZ app icon (ic_launcher.xml)

## If You Don't Have logo.png Yet:
Place your logo image file in `app/src/main/res/drawable/` and name it `logo.png`

The app should now build without any AAPT errors about missing attributes!
