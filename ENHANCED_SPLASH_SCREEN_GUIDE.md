# Enhanced Agricultural Splash Screen ‚úÖ

## What I've Created:

### üé® Agricultural Theme Elements:
1. **Trees on Left & Right**: Vector drawable trees that slide in from sides
2. **Crops at Bottom**: Agricultural crops (wheat, corn, rice) that slide up from bottom
3. **Center Logo**: Your logo without any background, displayed with fade-in and scale animation
4. **App Name**: "RNZ NDA Management" with fade-in animation

### üé¨ Animation Sequence:
1. **200ms**: Left tree slides in from left
2. **400ms**: Right tree slides in from right  
3. **500ms**: Your logo fades in and scales up (center)
4. **600ms**: Crops slide up from bottom
5. **1200ms**: App name fades in
6. **3000ms**: Transition to main app

### üìÅ Files Created:

#### Vector Drawables:
- `tree_left.xml` - Left side tree with foliage
- `tree_right.xml` - Right side tree (slightly different design)
- `crops_bottom.xml` - Agricultural crops (wheat, corn, rice)

#### Animations:
- `slide_in_left.xml` - Left tree animation
- `slide_in_right.xml` - Right tree animation  
- `fade_in_scale.xml` - Logo and app name animation
- `slide_in_bottom.xml` - Crops animation

#### Updated Files:

- `SplashActivity.kt` - Animation logic and timing
- `strings.xml` - App name changed to "RNZ NDA Management"

## üéØ Key Features:

### Logo Display:
- **No Background**: Your logo displays as-is without any white background
- **Perfect Centering**: Logo is centered and properly sized (220dp x 220dp)
- **Smooth Animation**: Fades in with gentle scale effect

### Agricultural Touch:
- **Trees**: Represent nature and growth
- **Crops**: Show wheat, corn, and rice - core agricultural products
- **Colors**: Natural greens, browns, and golden yellows
- **Professional**: Clean, modern agricultural aesthetic

### Animation Timing:
- **Smooth Sequence**: Each element appears in logical order
- **Professional Feel**: Not too fast, not too slow
- **Agricultural Story**: Trees ‚Üí Logo ‚Üí Crops ‚Üí Name (like growth cycle)

## üöÄ Result:

Your splash screen now tells an agricultural story:
1. Trees establish the natural environment
2. Your logo appears as the central focus
3. Crops show the agricultural products
4. App name confirms the purpose

The entire sequence takes 3 seconds and creates a professional, agricultural-themed introduction to your NDA Management app.

## üì± To Test:

1. Place your `logo.png` in `app/src/main/res/drawable/`
2. Build and run: `./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build`
3. Watch the beautiful agricultural splash screen animation!

Your logo will appear without any background, perfectly centered, with trees on the sides and crops below - giving it that perfect agricultural touch you requested! üåæüå≥
