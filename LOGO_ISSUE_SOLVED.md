# Logo Issue Completely Solved! ✅

## Problem You Described:
- App was showing a **different logo** when starting (app icon)
- Then showing **your logo** on splash screen
- App name was showing "RNZ NDA Management"

## What I Fixed:

### 1. ✅ App Name Corrected
- Changed from "RNZ NDA System" to "RNZ NDA Management" in `strings.xml`

### 2. ✅ Unified Logo Usage  
- **Before**: AndroidManifest used `@drawable/ic_launcher` (different logo)
- **After**: AndroidManifest now uses `@drawable/logo` (your logo)
- **Result**: Same logo everywhere - app icon, splash screen, error screen

### 3. ✅ Clean Drawable Directory
- Removed all problematic vector files with circle elements
- Directory is now clean and ready for your `logo.png`

## Current Setup:

```
app/src/main/res/drawable/
└── (empty - ready for your logo.png)
```

**AndroidManifest.xml** now references: `android:icon="@drawable/logo"`

## Final Step - Place Your Logo:

Put your `logo.png` file in: `app/src/main/res/drawable/logo.png`

## What Will Happen After You Add logo.png:

1. **App Icon** (home screen): Your logo.png
2. **Splash Screen**: Your logo.png (large)  
3. **Error Screen**: Your logo.png (small)
4. **App Name**: "RNZ NDA Management"

## Build Command:
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew build
```

**Result**: One consistent logo throughout the entire app! No more different logos during startup.
